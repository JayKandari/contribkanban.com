# ContribKanban.com

[ContribKanban.com](http://contribkanban.com) is an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) application powered by [Parse.com](https://parse.com/). It utilizes the [Drupal.org API](https://www.drupal.org/api) to provide kanban board for project issue queues.

This application was my attempt at learning AngularJS and providing a useful tool to the Drupal community. The goal is to provide the Drupal.org community with a simpler way to sprint on projects.

### Contributing

This project was just opened up May 4th 2015. It started off as a pet project at the beginning of the year and a tool for Global Sprint Weekened 2015. Feel free to open pull requests to improve the code and add tests.

### Support the project

I'm currently hosting the application on a personal server and able to use the free Parse.com service level. If you'd like to support the project outside of code contributions consider Gratipay.
